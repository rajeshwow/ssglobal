                <p>India is one of the largest producer of peanuts in the world. Indian peanuts are available in
                    different varieties: Bolds or Runners, Javas or Spanish and Red Natals; and have a rich nutty
                    flavour, sweet taste, crunchy texture and a relatively longer shelf life.</p>
                <p>Peanuts in India are available throughout the year due to a two-crop cycle harvested in March and
                    October. On an average, India produces 7- 8 million tonnes of peanuts (unshelled) every year. In
                    fact, considering the current export figures, India has a much larger potential to supply high
                    quality groundnuts to the international buyer.</p>
                <p>The awareness and concern for quality amongst the Indian peanut shellers and processors are growing
                    steadily. Multiple sorting and grading are fast becoming a norm. Indian shippers have the capability
                    to prepare and supply edible peanuts conforming to highest standards.</p>

                <h5 class="mb-10px">Peanut in Shell</h5>
                <p>The Peanut consists of an external hull (or shell) (21-29%) surrounding the nut (79-71%). Peanut
                    hulls, not to be confounded with peanut skins (which are the thin paper-like seed coats enclosing
                    the kernel), are a by-product of peanut processing. The shelling of peanuts is often the second
                    operation (after cleaning) of peanut processing, as both the production of peanut oil and the
                    production of peanut snacks, peanut butter and other peanut-based foods require kernels without
                    hulls (except the production of in-shell peanuts). Peanut hulls usually consist of fragmented hulls
                    with variable amounts of whole or broken kernels.</p>

                <h5 class="mb-10px">Varieties of Peanuts</h5>
                <p>The 2 major varieties of Peanuts produced in India are Bold (runners) and Java (Spanish). The Bold
                    variety peanuts have typically reddish brown skin with oblong shape, while Java variety have pink
                    skin with spherical in shape.</p>
                <p>Bold peanuts are the major oilseed of India. It accounts for around 25% of the total oilseed
                    production of the country. Annual production of India Peanuts and Indian Peanuts oil are around
                    5-8mln and 1.5mln tons respectively.</p>

                <h5 class="mb-10px"> Blanched Peanuts</h5>

                <p>Many nuts like almonds, peanuts or hazelnuts are grown in a shell. When the shell is removed there is
                    still a skin on the outside of the nutmeat. Blanching is a process that removes the skin from the
                    nut meat.</p>
                <p>So how do you blanch a nut? The process itself is done by putting the nuts in very hot water for
                    about a minute (blanching) then cooling them rapidly and rubbing off the skin.</p>
                <p>Well, neitherâ€¦ it just depend what you plan on doing, cooking or snacking on the nuts. Blanched nuts
                    are used mostly for cooking and baking. If the nut is unblanched and the skin is still on, the skin
                    will separate during cooking. Leaving your baked goodie, a husky mess.</p>
                <p>But, for snacking nothing beats an unblanched nut. The husk adds just a touch of flavor, and is
                    packed full of nutrients.</p>
