            <h2>Millet (Bajra)</h2>
            <p>Bajra is a traditional Hindi name for the Pennisetum glaucum crop — also known as pearl millet.

                It’s likewise known as dukn, cumbu, gero, sanio, kambu, babala, or bulrush millet (1).

                The grain is primarily grown in Africa and India, where it’s a major source of nutrition. However, it’s
                also grown and consumed in many other places around the world.

                Bajra refers to the edible seeds of pearl millet plants. They grow in various shades of white, yellow,
                gray, brown, and bluish-purple.</p>

            <h2>Sorghum (Jowar)</h2>
            <p>Jowar is commonly called by various names across India- jwaarie, jowar, jola, or jondhalaa and is used to
                make bhakri, jowar roti, or jolada rotti. Its English name Sorghum, comes from the family it belongs to,
                Sorghum Vulgare. Extensively cultivated in Asia and Africa, jowar is a staple source of nutrition in
                areas that are arid, and it also does not need special care for growing. There are 30 varieties of
                Sorghum, only one of which is used for human consumption. It is the 5th most important cereal in the
                world.</p>

            <h2>Whear Flour</h2>
            <p>Wheat flour is a powder made from the grinding of wheat used for human consumption. Wheat varieties are
                called "soft" or "weak" if gluten content is low, and are called "hard" or "strong" if they have high
                gluten content. Hard flour, or bread flour, is high in gluten, with 12% to 14% gluten content, and its
                dough has elastic toughness that holds its shape well once baked. Soft flour is comparatively low in
                gluten and thus results in a loaf with a finer, crumbly texture.[1] Soft flour is usually divided into
                cake flour, which is the lowest in gluten, and pastry flour, which has slightly more gluten than cake
                flour.</p>

            <h2>White Flour (Maida)</h2>
            <p>Maida is a white flour from the Indian subcontinent, made from wheat. Finely milled without any bran,
                refined, and
                bleached, it closely resembles cake flour. Maida is used extensively for making fast foods, baked goods
                such as
                pastries, bread,[1] several varieties of sweets, and traditional flatbreads.[2] Owing to this wide
                variety of uses,
                it is sometimes labeled and marketed as "all-purpose flour", though it is different from all-purpose
                flour.</p>

            <h2>Maize (Makka)</h2>
            <p>Maize (/meɪz/ MAYZ; Zea mays subsp. mays, from Spanish: maíz after Taino: mahiz), also known as corn
                (North American and Australian English), is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in
                southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago.[2][3] The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen
                inflorescences (or "tassels") and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that when fertilized
                yield kernels or seeds, which are fruits.[4][5] The term maize is preferred in formal, scientific, and
                international usage as a common name because it refers specifically to this one grain, unlike corn,
                which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region.

                Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of maize surpassing
                that of wheat or rice. In addition to being consumed directly by humans (often in the form of masa),
                maize is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn
                syrup.[6] The six major types of maize are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and
                sweet corn.[7] Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as
                kernels, while field corn varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses
                (including grinding into cornmeal or masa, pressing into corn oil, fermentation and distillation into
                alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey), and as feedstocks for the chemical industry. Maize is also
                used in making ethanol and other biofuels..</p>

            <h2>Semolina (Suji)</h2>
            <p> Semolina is the coarse, purified wheat middlings (intermediate milling stage) of durum wheat mainly used
                in making
                couscous, and sweet puddings.[1] The term semolina is also used to designate coarse middlings from other
                varieties
                of wheat, and sometimes other grains (such as rice or corn) as well.</p>
            <p>
                Semolina made from hard durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) is pale yellow in color.[5] It may
                be milled either coarse or fine, and both are used in a wide variety of sweet and savory dishes,
                including many types of pasta. Common names in other languages include:

                Italian: semola di grano duro; coarse (no descriptor), fine rimacinata <br>
                Greek: simigdáli σιμιγδάλι; coarse chondró χονδρό, fine psiló ψιλό <br>
                Arabic: samīd سميد; coarse ḵašin خشن, fine nāʿim ناعم <br>
                Turkish: irmik; coarse iri, fine ince <br>
                Hindustani: baṃsī ravā, bansi rava बंसी रवा (milled only coarse, not fine) <br>
