            <h2>Cumin (Jeera)</h2>
            <p>Cumin is the dried seed of the herb Cuminum cyminum, a member of the parsley family. The cumin plant
                grows to 30–50 cm (12–20 in) tall and is harvested by hand. It is an annual herbaceous plant, with a
                slender, glabrous, branched stem that is 20–30 cm (8–12 in) tall and has a diameter of 3–5 cm (1+1⁄4–2
                in).[11] Each branch has two to three sub-branches. All the branches attain the same height, so the
                plant has a uniform canopy.[11] The stem is colored grey or dark green. The leaves are 5–10 cm (2–4 in)
                long, pinnate or bipinnate, with thread-like leaflets. The flowers are small, white or pink, and borne
                in umbels. Each umbel has five to seven umbellets.[11] The fruit is a lateral fusiform or ovoid achene
                4–5 mm (1⁄6–1⁄5 in) long, containing two mericarps with a single seed.[11] Cumin seeds have eight ridges
                with oil canals.[11] They resemble caraway seeds, being oblong in shape, longitudinally ridged, and
                yellow-brown in color, like other members of the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) such as caraway,
                parsley, and dill.[12]</p>

            <h2>Saunaph (Saunf)</h2>
            <p>Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is a flowering plant species in the carrot family.[2] It is a hardy,
                perennial herb[3] with yellow flowers and feathery leaves.[4] It is indigenous to the shores of the
                Mediterranean but has become widely naturalized in many parts of the world, especially on dry soils near
                the sea-coast and on riverbanks.

                It is a highly flavorful herb used in cooking and, along with the similar-tasting anise, is one of the
                primary ingredients of absinthe. Florence fennel or finocchio (UK: /fɪˈnɒkioʊ/, US: /-ˈnoʊk-/, Italian:
                [fiˈnɔkkjo]) is a selection with a swollen, bulb-like stem base that is used as a vegetable.</p>

            <p>Ajwain's small, oval-shaped, seed-like fruits are pale brown schizocarps, which resemble the seeds of
                other plants in the family Apiaceae such as caraway, cumin and fennel. They have a bitter and pungent
                taste, with a flavor similar to anise and oregano. They smell almost exactly like thyme because they
                also contain thymol, but they are more aromatic and less subtle in taste, as well as being somewhat
                bitter and pungent. Even a small number of fruits tends to dominate the flavor of a dish.[5]</p>

                starch mucilage.[citation needed] The viscosity of psyllium mucilage dispersions are relatively
                unaffected between temperatures of 20 and 50 °C (68 and 122 °F), by pH from 2 to 10, and by salt (sodium

            <h2>Fenugreek seeds (Methi)</h2>
            <p>Fenugreek (/ˈfɛnjʊɡriːk/; Trigonella foenum-graecum) is an annual plant in the family Fabaceae, with
                leaves consisting of three small obovate to oblong leaflets. It is cultivated worldwide as a semiarid
                crop. Its seeds and leaves are common ingredients in dishes from the Indian subcontinent, and have been
                used as a culinary ingredient since ancient times.[2] Its use as a food ingredient in small quantities
                is safe.[3][4]

                Although sold as a dietary supplement,[5] there is no clinical evidence that fenugreek has therapeutic
                properties.[4][5] Commonly used in traditional medicine, fenugreek can increase the risk of serious
                adverse effects, including allergic reactions.[4][5]</p>

            <p>Turmeric, or yellow ginger, is a spice similar to ginger in appearance, but it has a totally different
                taste, and it gives its characteristic yellow color to the food.

                Turmeric is often used as a low-cost substitute for saffron. The color is similar, but the taste is very
                different.

                Turmeric, along with dill, gives pickles their characteristic taste.

                Be careful using Turmeric, as it can overpower a dish easily.

            <h2>Chilli </h2>
            <p> Chili peppers (also chile, chile pepper, chilli pepper, or chilli[3]), from Nahuatl chīlli (Nahuatl
                pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃiːlːi] (listen)), are varieties of the berry-fruit of plants from the genus
                Capsicum, which are members of the nightshade family Solanaceae, cultivated for their pungency.[4] Chili
                peppers are widely used in many cuisines as a spice to add "heat" to dishes. Capsaicin and related
                compounds known as capsaicinoids are the substances giving chili peppers their intensity when ingested
                or applied topically. While chili peppers are (to varying degrees) pungent or "spicy", there are other
                varieties of capsicum such as bell peppers (UK: peppers) which generally provide additional sweetness
                and flavor to a meal rather than “heat.”

            <p> Coriander (/ˌkɒriˈændər, ˈkɒriændər/;[1] Coriandrum sativum) is an annual herb in the family Apiaceae.
                It is also known as Chinese parsley, dhania, or cilantro (/sɪˈlæntroʊ, -ˈlɑːn-/).[2] All parts of the
                plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds (which are both a herb and a spice) are the
                parts most traditionally used in cooking.

                Most people perceive coriander as having a tart, lemon/lime taste, but to nearly a quarter of those
                surveyed, the leaves taste like dish soap, linked to a gene that detects some specific aldehydes that
                can produce soapy sensation from the odorant substances.[3]

            <h2> Cardamom(Ilaychi)</h2>
            <p> Cardamom (/ˈkɑːrdəməm/), sometimes cardamon or cardamum,[1] is a spice made from the seeds of several
                plants in the genera Elettaria and Amomum in the family Zingiberaceae. Both genera are native to the
                Indian subcontinent and Indonesia. They are recognized by their small seed pods: triangular in
                cross-section and spindle-shaped, with a thin, papery outer shell and small, black seeds; Elettaria pods
                are light green and smaller, while Amomum pods are larger and dark brown.

                Species used for cardamom are native throughout tropical and subtropical Asia. The first references to
                cardamom are found in Sumer, and in the Ayurvedic literatures of India.[2] Nowadays it is also
                cultivated in Guatemala, Malaysia, and Tanzania.[3] The German coffee planter Oscar Majus Klöffer
                introduced Indian cardamom to cultivation in Guatemala before World War I; by 2000, that country had
                become the biggest producer and exporter of cardamom in the world, followed by India.[4]

            <h2> Black Pepper (Kali Mirch)</h2>
            <p> Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit,
                known as a peppercorn, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning. The fruit is a drupe
                (stonefruit) which is about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter (fresh and fully mature), dark red, and contains
                a stone which encloses a single pepper seed. Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be
                described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green
                pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds).[2]

                Black pepper is native to the Malabar Coast[3][4] of India, and the Malabar pepper is extensively
                cultivated there and in other tropical regions.

                Ground, dried, and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a
                traditional medicine. Black pepper is the world's most traded spice, and is one of the most common
                spices added to cuisines around the world. Its spiciness is due to the chemical compound piperine, which
                is a different kind of spicy from the capsaicin characteristic of chili peppers. It is ubiquitous in the
                Western world as a seasoning, and is often paired with salt and available on dining tables in shakers or
                mills.
